Fake vs Real News Classifier

Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based classifier that distinguishes between fake and real news articles. The model uses data collected from two popular fact-checking websites: Politifact and Gossipcop. By analyzing features such as sentiment, named entities (organizations, locations, and people), and article characteristics, the classifier predicts whether a given news article is fake or real.

Dataset

The dataset is composed of news articles obtained from:

Politifact (both fake and real articles)
Gossipcop (both fake and real articles)
These datasets are preprocessed and cleaned to extract meaningful features such as named entities, sentiment scores, article length, and tweet counts (a measure of popularity).
